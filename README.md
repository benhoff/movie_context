# movie_context
playing around with deep learning, reddit, and memes


Currently working on scrapping the /r/gameofthrones from the subreddit's exsistence to see if it's possible to extract MEME context using reddit's nested comment trees. Exploratory coding.

This will be documented in a series of blog posts.

See [this post](http://benhoff.net/movie-quotes-in-context.html), for the first in the series.
